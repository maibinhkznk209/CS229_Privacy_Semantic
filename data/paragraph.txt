This Privacy Policy explains what information Google collects when you use its services, why it collects it, and the options you have to manage your information. The specific data collected and the way it is used can vary based on how you use the services and which privacy controls you choose. When you are not signed in, Google may store collected data under unique identifiers associated with the browser, app, or device in order to maintain preferences across sessions. When you create or use a Google Account, you provide personal information such as your name and password, and you may also add details like a phone number or payment information. Google also collects content that you create, upload, or receive while using its services, such as emails, photos, documents, and comments. As you use the services, Google collects technical and interaction data about your apps, browsers, and devices (including identifiers and information like IP address, date, time, and referrer URL), using technologies such as cookies and server logs. Google uses collected data to deliver services, keep them working as intended, improve and develop features, personalize content and ads depending on settings, communicate with users, and protect against fraud, abuse, and security risks. Many services allow users to share information publicly or privately, and content shared publicly may become accessible through search engines. Google retains different kinds of data for different periods depending on what the data is, how it is used, and the user’s settings, including options to delete or auto-delete some information while other data may be kept longer for business or legal needs.
